There are three types of GAN (Generative Adversial Network).
i) Normal GAN - The generator takes input random numbers and produce a random real image on which it is trained. The discriminator is given a input batch of real image and trained it to discriminate to identify between real and fake images
ii) C-GAN (Conditional Generative Adversial Network)
iii)pix to pix GAN
